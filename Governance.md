## Package Maintenance Working Group Governance

### Collaborators

### WG Membership

The package-maintenance team has two levels of membership. Administrative
members and regular members. 

If you'd like to be listed as regular team member, open a PR adding yourself
to [MEMBERS.md](MEMBERS.md) along with a few words on how you are planning
to contribute to the team's efforts.

Administrative members take on additional levels of responsibility with
respect to managing the [pkgjs](https://github.com/pkgjs) organization
and the other repositories managed by the working group. Administrative
members should have a long standing involvement in the working group.

Individuals who have made significant contributions and who wish to be
considered as an Administrative member may create an issue or
contact an Administrative WG member directly. It is not necessary
to wait for an Administrative WG member to nominate the individual.

There is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for WG
membership beyond these rules.

The WG may add additional Administrative members to the WG by
consensus. If there are any objections to adding any individual
member, an attempt should be made to resolve those objections
following the WG's Consensus Seeking Process.

A WG member may be removed from the WG by voluntary resignation, or by
consensus of the Administrative WG members.

Changes to Administrative WG membership should be posted in
the agenda, and may be suggested as any other agenda
item (see "WG Meetings" below).

If an addition or removal is proposed, this should be raised in an 
issue, tagged for the next agenda, and consensus should be reached
in the issue. This is to ensure
that all Administrative  members are given the opportunity to
participate in all membership decisions. The addition or removal
is considered approved once the issue has been open for 2 meetings
or 14 days whichever is longer, and at least half the Administrative
members are in favor.

No more than 1/3 of the Administrative WG members may be
affiliated with the same employer. If removal or resignation
of a WG member, or a change of employment by a WG member,
creates a situation where more than 1/3 of the WG membership
shares an employer, then the situation must be immediately
remedied by the resignation or removal of one or more
Administrative WG members affiliated with the
over-represented employer(s).

For the current list of members, see the project [README.md][].

### WG Meetings

The WG meets regularly as scheduled on the Node.js
[calendar](https://nodejs.org/calendar). Each meeting should be
published to YouTube.

Items are added to the WG agenda that are considered contentious or
are modifications of governance, contribution policy, WG membership,
or release process.

The intention of the agenda is not to approve or review all patches;
that should happen continuously on GitHub. 

Any community member or contributor can ask that something be added to
the next meeting's agenda by logging a GitHub Issue. Any Collaborator,
WG member or the moderator can add the item to the agenda by adding
the ***package-maintenance-agenda*** tag to the issue.

Prior to each WG meeting the moderator will share the Agenda with
members of the WG. WG members can add any items they like to the
agenda at the beginning of each meeting. The moderator and the WG
cannot veto or remove items.

The moderator is responsible for summarizing the discussion of each
agenda item and sends it as a pull request after the meeting.

### Repository Management
All repositories under the management of the package maintenance team must include:

* LICENCE.md from the list approved by the OpenJS Foundation
* CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md referencing the Node.js Code of conduct in the admin repo.
* CONTRIBUTING.md which includes the current version of the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) used by the Node.js Project
* An PR template(s) used for all Pull requests which includes the current version of the DCO used by the Node.js Project.
* A README.md which includes references to the GOVERNANCE.md in the package-maintenance repository as the authoritative governance which applies to the repository. 

#### nodejs/package-maintenance 

##### Maintainers

Maintainers for the nodejs/package-maintenance repo are managed
through the [package-maintenance](https://github.com/orgs/nodejs/teams/package-maintenance/)
team.  Administrative members are given the maintainer role for that team
and can add/remove members as they join or leave the team.

##### Landing PRs

The package maintenance team policy on landing a PR in this repository, except for specific
cases outlined below, is for there to be:
- At least 4 approvals from regular members other than the author of the PR
- No blocking reviews
- 7 day period from the 4th approval to merging
- In the event there are 4 approvals but existing pending reviews still exist a countdown of 21 days will start. During
the countdown period every possible effort must be made to contact the reviewer. If the reviewer cannot be 
contacted to review the changes within the countdown period, and their requested changes are believed to be addressed, the PR may be landed. This rule is not intended to circumvent
the policy of consensus when it is known that consensus has not been reached.

For the following cases:
  - PRs for minutes
  - Changes which don't change semantics (for examples, rewording, etc.)

The requirements are as follows:
- At least 2 approvals from collaborators
- No blocking reviews

All PRs shall follow the [contributions policy](CONTRIBUTING.md)

#### nodejs/ci-config-travis

##### Maintainers

Maintainers for this repository are managed
through the [ci-config-travis-maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/nodejs/teams/ci-config-travis-maintainers/)
team. Administrative members are given the maintainer role for that team
and can add/remove members as appropriate.

##### Landing PRs

The package maintenance team policy on landing a PR in this repository
is for there to be:
- At least 2 approvals from package-maintenance members other than the author of the PR
- No blocking reviews
- 72 hours since the PR was opened 

#### nodejs/ci-config-github-actions

##### Maintainers

Maintainers for this repository are managed
through the [ci-config-github-actions-maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/nodejs/teams/ci-config-github-actions-maintainers/)
team. Administrative members are given the maintainer role for that team
and can add/remove members as appropriate.

##### Landing PRs

The package maintenance team policy on landing a PR in this repository
is for there to be:
- At least 2 approvals from package-maintenance members other than the author of the PR
- No blocking reviews
- 72 hours since the PR was opened 

#### pkgjs organization
All members of the pkgjs organization will be required to have 2FA enabled, 
and the repository will be configured to enforce this requirement.

##### Adding or removing repositories

Any repository created under the Pkgjs GitHub Organization is considered to be
a project under the ownership of the OpenJS Foundation, and thereby subject
to the Intellectual Property and Governance policies of the Foundation.

Any member may request the management of repositories within the
Pkgjs GitHub Organization by opening an issue in the
[package-maintenance repository][nodejs/package-maintenance].
The actions requested could be:

- Creating a new repository
- Deleting an existing repository
- Archiving an existing repository
- Transferring a repository into or out of the organization

Provided there are no objections from any members raised in
the issue, such requests are approved automatically after 72 hours. If any
objection is made, the request may be moved to a vote
of the Administrative members.

In certain cases, OpenJS Cross Project Council and/or OpenJS Foundation Board
of Directors approval may also be required. (Most likely in the case of
transferring a repository into or out of the organization).

##### Publishing Packages

When publishing packages owned by the [pkgjs](https://github.com/pkgjs) org, the maintainers of the project
can choose to use the global scope or the `@pkgjs` scope on the registry. When
the package is first published, we always turn on "Require two-factor authentication to publish". In
the case of using the global scope, you also need to transfer ownership of the
package to the `@pkgjs` org on npm.

##### Maintainers

Maintainers for the repositories in the Pkgjs repository are managed
through a team created for each repository.  They will be named as
[REPO-maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/pkgjs/teams/REPO-maintainers/)
where REPO is the name of the repository.  Administrative members are given
the maintainer role these team and can add/remove members as appropriate.
In addition all maintainers for a given repository can add/remove
maintainers are given the maintainer role for the teams for which they are
added and can add/remove members as appropriate.

##### Landing PRs

The package maintenance team policy on landing a PR in the repositories within the Pkgjs
repository is for there to be:
- At least 1 approval from package-maintenance members other than the author of the PR,
  unless there is single maintainer for the repository. In that case the single maintainer
  can land their own PRs.
- No blocking reviews
- 72 hours since the PR was opened 

Certain types of pull requests can be fast-tracked and may land after a shorter
delay. For example:

* Focused changes that affect only documentation and/or the test suite:
  * `code-and-learn` tasks often fall into this category.
  * `good-first-issue` pull requests may also be suitable.
* Changes that fix regressions:
  * Regressions that break the workflow (red CI or broken compilation).
  * Regressions that happen right before a release, or reported soon after.

To propose fast-tracking a pull request, apply the `fast-track` label. Then add
a comment that Collaborators may upvote.

If someone disagrees with the fast-tracking request, remove the label. Do not
fast-track the pull request in that case.

The pull request may be fast-tracked if two Collaborators approve the
fast-tracking request. To land, the pull request itself still needs two
Collaborator approvals and a passing CI.

Collaborators may request fast-tracking of pull requests they did not author.
In that case only, the request itself is also one fast-track approval. Upvote
the comment anyway to avoid any doubt.

### Consensus Seeking Process

The WG follows a [Consensus Seeking][] decision-making model.

When an agenda item has appeared to reach a consensus the moderator
will ask "Does anyone object?" as a final call for dissent from the
consensus.

If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus a WG member can call for
either a closing vote or a vote to table the issue to the next
meeting. The call for a vote must be seconded by a majority of the WG
or else the discussion will continue. Simple majority wins.

Note that changes to administrative WG membership require
consensus. If there are any objections to adding or removing
individual members, an effort must be made to resolve
those objections. If consensus cannot be reached, a
vote may be called following the process above. Administrative
members are responsible for voting in these cases.
