# DOCS

This is the location for documentation, guides and other information developed by the package-maintenance team.  It is intended to provide as a set of resources and references for all package developers and maintainers. 


## Goals and Objectives
By providing these guidelines and recommendations, the hope is that projects can benefit from the combined experience of the Node.js project and the community at large in a way that helps facilitate knowledge sharing and collaboration.  For example, documentation for topics like Continuous Integration can be used to share tooling configurations and setups that can help reduce the barrier to entry and time needed for authors to setup their own projects.

> _In the spirit of open source, we are always open to contributions to help improve these docs, so if you find anything missing or that could be improved, please don't hesitiate to open an issue or PR for the team._


## Notes and Assumptions
As Node.js and most of the packages in the ecosystem are predominantly hosted on GitHub, there will be a natural leaning towards the features and capabilities provided by the GitHub platform referenced in these docs.  However, we understand that not one size fits all and so will aim to provide recommendations that are well rounded.  In this way, we want to at least communicate the foundational elements such that this information can and then be applied in whatever way fits a package's given workflow.
