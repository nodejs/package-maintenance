# Versioning 

The package maintenance group requires that supported packages follow the issued 
NPM [best practices](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning). Most packages 
that receive help are expected to already be following this guidance. However if a 
package is not already on a major semver release number we recommend on bumping up 
to version 1.0.0 on the next semver major release.

It is also recommended that increasing the minimum required version of node is a 
breaking change and should be accompanied by major semver change.
