# Creating Package Maintenance Tools

If you have an idea for a tool that can help our community to hold themselves accountable to the best practices identified by the Package Maintenance Team, follow the process below to get your idea from proposal to published.

1. Propose the tool here in the Package Maintenance Team repo by adding an issue describing your idea

2. Put your proposal on the [agenda for the next meeting](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+meeting+)

3. Discuss with the group during our team meeting so we can plan next steps. (See [Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=nodejs.org_nr77ama8p7d7f9ajrpnu506c98@group.calendar.google.com) for date/time)

4. Build the tool as a public GitHub repo that follows Package Maintenance Team standards
- https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/blob/master/docs/drafts/Baseline%20practice%20-%20Document%20support%20levels.md

5. Release your tool as a public npm module (following our [documented steps for publishing modules](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/blob/master/docs/drafts/PUBLISH-GUIDELINES.md))

6. **As Needed:** Follow the steps for [transferring you repo into the org.](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/0f2af76492b9efff8bafedbf650bb0a3c4f76e44/transfer-repo-into-the-org.md)
