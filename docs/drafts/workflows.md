# Workflows

As contributions come into a project, establishing a clear roadmap for the project, expections for code quality and formatting, communication channels, and more, can make the workflows for both maintainers and contributors clear and help manage and set expectations.  Below are some considerations to keep in mind as you steer your projects.

## Contributing Guidelines
- Contributing.md

## Roadmap 
- pointing contributor's in the right direction
- defining priorities for the project
- Projects / Milestones / Labels (good first issue, pinned issues)

## Issue Templates
- really good for bug reports
- RFCs can be a good way to facilitate technical design discussions, project stewardship

## Automation
