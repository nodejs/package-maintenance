# Licensing

It is required that any package supported have an appropriate license. The 
maintainers may choose not to support a package with a license that is restrictive 
or may be construed as a patent license.

There are many licenses to choose from. We would refer package owners who have not 
already choosen a license to review the [commonly used SPDX licenses](https://spdx.org/licenses/) and 
[suggested means to choose license](https://choosealicense.com/).

This is an ordered list of the most popular licenses from the public registry with MIT being the most
popular.

1. The license is literally "SEE LICENSE", i.e. it refers to a license.txt
2. "Unlicense" is "The Unlicense", not un-licensed code
