# Licensing

It is required that any package supported have an appropriate license. The 
maintainers may choose not to support a package with a license that is restrictive 
or may be construed as a patent license.

There are many licenses to choose from. We would refer package owners who have not 
already chosen a license to review the [commonly used SPDX licenses](https://spdx.org/licenses/) and 
[suggested means to choose license](https://choosealicense.com/).

This is an ordered list of the most popular licenses from the public registry with MIT being the most
popular.

- MIT
- Apache
- BSD
- ISC
- SEE LICENSE
- MPL
- GPL
- CC0-1.0
- LGPL
- Unlicense
- pemrouz.mit-license.org
- Artistic-2.0
- AGPL

1. The license is literally "SEE LICENSE", i.e. it refers to a license.txt
2. "Unlicense" is "The Unlicense", not un-licensed code
