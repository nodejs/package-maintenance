# How we could help MQTT.js

Based on the MQTT.js answers the actions to help this package need to solve:

1. management of issues
    1. add issues templates
    1. label the actual issue list
1. find collaborators to refactor tests in order to fix CI
    1. identify some companies that use MQTT.js
    1. ask to them to start a collaboration to let the module rise again
1. improve documentation
    1. create a word-cloud of the issues' text to understand the most frequent problem
    1. create good-first-issue for those missing docs
