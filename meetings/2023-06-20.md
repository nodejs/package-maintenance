### nodejs/package-maintenance

* Goals for 2023 [#550](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/550)
  * two items cover package.json
    * ecosystem keys and best practices
    * seems quite similar to documenting runtime support
    * <https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1102>
    * Michael - this looks related - <https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1102>
    * Michael - also channel with related discussion - <https://openjs-foundation.slack.com/archives/C05AWQH5E4R>  (improve-package-json)
    * Wes agreed, just figuring out what we want to do. Idea is to find documentation for existing keys/set of keys that are already being used
      * For example, we configure out the common subset between npm, yarn, pnpm, etc.
      * Could be use as jumping off point to get alignment across similar usage (runtime, package manager etc.)
      * Also good ways to better understand what Package.json depends on, for example SemVer
    * Michael sounds like the ongoing effort is something that Package-maintenance team should participate but not itsâ€™ being driven at on a more general non node.js specific level.

* Create doc on how to support ESM and CommonJS when publishing modules [#542](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/542)
  * No update this week

* Status update and next steps for "pkgjs/create" (create-pkg) [#458](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/458)
  * Discussed and suggested that Ethan connect with Wes to define the plan/next steps.
