## Agenda

## Announcements

*Extracted from **package-maintenance-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

* No announcements this week

### nodejs/package-maintenance

* globally installing npm should not be the recommended way for Mac and Linux [#591](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/591)
  * Michael: believe this should be covered by the update to the Website in - <https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/blob/main/docs/version-management/proposal-revise-downloads-page.md>

* Create doc on how to support ESM and CommonJS when publishing modules [#542](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/542)
  * Luke was doing some research and found - <https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#dual-commonjses-module-packages> which covers a lot of the ground. Is this all we need? -> title is Dual CommonJS/ES module packages.
  * Should this be a separate guide to make it more discoverable?
  * Agreed that adding content to nodejs.org learn section as it will be more visible/discoverable.
  * Next step would be PRâ€™ing a learn section, then possibly removing overlapping content for the API docs.

* Status update and next steps for "pkgjs/create" (create-pkg) [#458](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/458)
  * Rick, PR to move to mono-repo landed, meta-interop meeting take precedence.
