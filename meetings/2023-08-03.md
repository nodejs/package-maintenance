## Agenda

## Announcements

*Extracted from **package-maintenance-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/package-maintenance

* Impactful Projects Statusboard [#569](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/569)
  * No progress to report this week.
  * Scope of packages, just OpenJS ones
    * Darcy, better to have a wider net
    * Michael, agree broader scope makes sense
    * Rick, maybe 1000 might be too many, possibly start at 500 to start?
    * Darcy can do initial run with 1000 and see how long it takes

* Create doc on how to support ESM and CommonJS when publishing modules [#542](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/542)
  * No update this week.
  * Michael mentioned that support both ESM and CommonJS and interoperability are a top issue

* Status update and next steps for "pkgjs/create" (create-pkg) [#458](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/458)
  * No progress this time.
  * Rick plans to try to get to this in the next month or so, Darcy also looking at tooling in this area as well. Darcy/Rick will work/sync together on this.  Seems like both have requirements for the package and want to consume it.

## Project Board Review (maybe, if time permits)

Ask participants about the state of [Project Board](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/projects/1) and necessary changes if time permits.
