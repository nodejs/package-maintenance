## Agenda

## Announcements

*Extracted from **package-maintenance-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/package-maintenance

* globally installing npm should not be the recommended way for Mac and Linux [#591](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/591)
  * Work that Geoffrey is working on directly addresses this.
  * Michael quick discussion of some background
  * Wes, next step is to pull some next smaller steps from the larger doc I’d put together
    * one of biggest feedback points, was corepack should not be enabled because it did not
      solve all problems  
    * do we need to define requirements, uplevel an existing tool, etc.
    * maybe try to evolve corepack into the right tool
  * Michael, maybe write ideal user experience
  * Wes - section here - <https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/pull/594/files#diff-375ce736356cc2a5e8dbc4e7a91e1242cd31befec1ce246dd6121dc0dd3eb506R65> is a start on that.
  * Geoffrey, next step may be to list instructions, there are some tools that might cover use case
    * maybe before doing anything else we should explore the instructions to see which comes
     closest to the desired user experience
  * One thing that could narrow down work is it a hard requirement that a single tool manages
    both runtime and package manager.
    * No for what we put on the website
    * For end state, should be 1 something you have to install
  * Continued discussion over next steps
    * One key point, is that if there is an external tool that fits UX, we should work to see if it can
      be foundation project?
    * Geoffrey, if we choose a couple then a bit less of an issue
  * Geoffrey, is it a requirement to manage both Node.js and Package manager ?
    * Wes there are issues if you can’t manage both
  * Next steps are
    * Discussion of approach with TSC
    * Define instructions for Website
    * Document ideal UX as next step
  
* Create doc on how to support ESM and CommonJS when publishing modules [#542](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/542)
  * skipped as we ran out of time

* Status update and next steps for "pkgjs/create" (create-pkg) [#458](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/458)
  * skipped as we ran out of time
