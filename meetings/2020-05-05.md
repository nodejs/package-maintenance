* Submit sessions to Collab Summit [#335](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/335)
  * Wes, what is the format
  * Michael gave short, possibly inaccurate description
  * Glenn, we should have quite a lot to talk about
  * Wes, part of reason we got engagement was because it was in person
    will be interested to see if we get the same out of a virtual event.
  * Michael, could make sense to focus on aspects that benefit from broader audience
  * Glen, possibly talk with some of the other open JS projects, are other maintainers interested.
  * Owen, since Axios was mentioned, one of the key factors was identifying champions 
    maintainer
  * Wes will volunteer to open issue for session and team members know when its there for 
    comment.

* Dependents tooling [#327](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/327)

  * discussion on proposed governance - https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/pull/338
  * Tierney, has org management tool for electron. Bot deployed to heroku that configures 
    and manages repo creation, integrates with slack, identifies if things that are wrong (for 
    example member access level changed manually instead of through tool) 
  * Wes, questions
    * Does this matter for the charter ?
    * npm publish management would be another desired feature
    * who would run the instance?
  * Wes what about npm publish, 
    * Tierney they might accept a plug in but will likely not do it themselves

  * Some discussion on the charter.

* Next steps on Support levels in Package.json [#192](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/192)
 * Michael point out https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/355 for those who might be
