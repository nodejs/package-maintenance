# package-maintenance team

Repository for discussion on how to help ensure baseline
maintenance and ability to safely use key packages in the
ecosystem with current Node.js versions. You can find more
about this initiative in the article:
[Call to Action: Accelerating Node.js Growth](https://medium.com/@nodejs/call-to-action-accelerating-node-js-growth-e4862bee2919)

## Goals

* Define and document how to prioritize which packages are key to the
  Node.js ecosystem and how/what assistance can/should be provided.
  One of the key aspects of this is understanding what communication
  channels we need in order to be able to identify when specific
  issues are slowing migration from one Node.js version to another
  or causing friction in the ecosystem in some other way.
* Building and documenting guidance, tools and processes that
  businesses can use to identify packages on which they depend,
  and then to use this information to be able to build a business
  case that supports their organization and developers helping to
  maintain those packages.
* Documenting a backlog and providing resources that help
  businesses identify how their developers can ramp up and
  get engaged to help. Test and validate a workflow by helping
  with some issues that are slowing migration to Node.js 10.x.
* Building, documenting and evangelizing guidance, tools and
  processes (for example LTS for modules)
  that make it easier for maintainers to manage multiple
  streams and accept help from those who depend on their module.

## Joining

We encourage participation from members across the Node.js and JavaScript
ecosystem. Feel free to join schedule meetings and participate
in the issues within the repository. If you'd like to be listed as
a team member, open a PR adding yourself to this README.md along with
a few words on how you are planning to contribute to the team's
efforts.

## Logistics

### Meetings

Meetings of the working group typically occur **TBD** as shown on the
the node.js project [calendar](https://nodejs.org/calendar).
A few days before each meeting, an
[issue](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues)
will be created with the date and time of the meeting.
The issue will provide schedule logistics as well as
an agenda, links to meeting minutes, and
information about how to join as a participant or a viewer.
