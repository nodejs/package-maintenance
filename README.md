# package-maintenance team

Repository for discussion on how to help ensure baseline
maintenance and ability to safely use key packages in the
ecosystem with current Node.js versions. You can find more
about this initiative in the article:
[Call to Action: Accelerating Node.js Growth](https://medium.com/@nodejs/call-to-action-accelerating-node-js-growth-e4862bee2919)

## Goals

* Define and document how to prioritize which packages are key to the
  Node.js ecosystem, and how/what assistance can/should be provided.
  One key aspect is understanding what communication
  channels are needed in order to identify when specific
  issues are slowing migration from one Node.js version to another,
  or causing friction in the ecosystem.
* Building and documenting guidance, tools and processes so
  businesses can identify the packages they depend on.
  Businesses can use the information to build a business
  case which supports both the organization and developers helping to
  maintain those packages.
* Documenting a backlog and providing resources to help
  businesses identify how their developers can contribute, and
  get engaged. Developers can test and validate a workflow to help
  with issues slowing migration to Node.js 10.x.
* Building, documenting and evangelizing guidance, tools and
  processes (for example LTS for modules)
  can make it easier for maintainers to manage multiple
  streams, and accept help from those who depend on their module.

## For Maintainers

Are you a maintainer of an open source project looking for help and resources maintaining your package and community?  To get you started,
- Review [our growing set of documentation](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/blob/master/docs/README.md) around topics like CI / CD, testing, and governance

### Feedback

Want to provide feedback on your experiences as a maintainer?  Want to let us know what topic and tools you think would be helpful to pursue within this group?  Open a PR to fill out [this survey](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/blob/master/pilots/SURVEY.md) and the team will be sure to review and get in touch with you.

## Joining

We encourage participation from members across the Node.js and JavaScript
ecosystem. Feel free to join schedule meetings and participate
in the issues within the repository.

## How to Join

The package-maintenance team has two levels of membership. Administrative
members and regular members.

If you'd like to be listed as regular team member, open a PR adding yourself
to this [MEMBERS.md](MEMBERS.md) along with a few words on how you are planning
to contribute to the team's efforts.

Administrative members take on additional levels of responsibility with
respect to managing the [pkgjs](https://github.com/pkgjs) organization
and the other repositories managed by the working group. Administrative
members should have a long standing involvement in the working group.

Individuals who have made significant contributions and who wish to be
considered as an Administrative member may create an issue or
contact an Administrative WG member directly. It is not necessary
to wait for an Administrative WG member to nominate the individual.

For more details refer to the WG Governance document.

## Logistics

### Meetings

Meetings of the working group typically occur bi-weekly as shown on the
the node.js project [calendar](https://nodejs.org/calendar).
A few days before each meeting, an
[issue](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues)
will be created with the date and time of the meeting.
The issue will provide schedule logistics as well as
an agenda, links to meeting minutes, and
information about how to join as a participant or a viewer.

### Communications

The working group can chat on the [Node.js slack](https://node-js.slack.com/)
in the channel `#package-maintenance` in order to continue conversations beyond the meetings.
All the contributors are expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
of the Node.js project.

To join on slack you have to [send a request](http://www.nodeslackers.com/) and wait
to be accepted: it is a manual workflow, so it could take some days (we are working to help improve this).
